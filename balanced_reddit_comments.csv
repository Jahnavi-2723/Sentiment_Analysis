"A lot of ad companies store way more data then you think. Worked for a company who bought this data. An ad company that was one the of the largest for freemium games tracked more than you‚Äôd ever think about. If you had an Android phone they were at one point using the altimeter of you phone to see what height you were at. 

Now you may ask why? Well if they can pin your normal altitude when you use it and then let‚Äôs say you play the game at a common time of day. The altimeter says you are 24 ft up, aka 2 stories. Well if that time of day when they record it is during working hours, they know you are two stories high. Now they also have you general location. So they can make the correlation that you are two stories high at a commercial building. That building has let‚Äôs say 10 stories and it‚Äôs multi-use. Let‚Äôs say the second floor at that address is company X. They can basically correlate that because during working hours you go to this general location and are two stories up, they know you are at that company.

"By Fred Smith:

*Would-be Tesla Cybertruck owners are now reporting that some trucks scheduled for delivery are being held back for additional inspection.*

*The issue comes after over a month of reports from existing owners that their trucks have had issues with loose bodywork, including at least one owner who has footage of a panel flying off of his truck at speed.*

*Most owners waiting on the delay have not reported any specific reason for the wait, but one user on a Cybertruck owner forum has shared a screenshot from a conversation with a service advisor that suggests ""the cantrail concern"" is the problem being inspected.*

*This is the trim piece that follows along the side of the Cybertruck's roofline, starting at the edge of the truck's A-pillar and continuing to the edge of the bed. It is also the piece of bodywork most frequently mentioned in reports of loose bodywork, including in what are now four different official NHTSA complaints.*

*Reid Tomasko, the owner who shared footage of his truck shedding this particular piece of bodywork at speed, told Road & Track in February that he had seen the issue on ""five to seven"" different trucks encountered at his wrapping business. This includes his own truck and another truck in his shop when he filmed a YouTube video that dug into the problem.*

Having a plan gives everyone confidence in where we are headed if we do regain control of our country and give people more confidence to oppose these soul less people.¬†

Let's put policy first and party affiliation/identity politics second.¬†

Universal Healthcare

Rationale: Ensures that every citizen has access to affordable, quality medical care, reducing preventable deaths and the financial ruin many families face.

Potential Impact: Improved public health, reduced long-term costs through prevention, and increased economic productivity.

2. Progressive Tax Reform

Rationale: Taxing the ultra-wealthy and high-income earners more fairly could help fund public services and reduce income inequality.

Potential Impact: Increased government revenue to support infrastructure, education, healthcare, and social safety nets; however, as noted before, this alone might not balance the budget without broader spending reforms.

3. Climate Change Mitigation and Green Energy Investment

Rationale: Addressing climate change is essential for long-term economic stability, public health, and national security.

Potential Impact: Transitioning to renewable energy sources, creating millions of green jobs, reducing environmental damage, and positioning the US as a leader in global sustainability.

4. Education and Workforce Development

Rationale: Strengthening education from early childhood through higher education and vocational training equips citizens for the evolving economy.

Potential Impact: More equitable opportunities, a more skilled workforce, reduced socioeconomic gaps, and increased competitiveness in a global market.

5. Criminal Justice and Policing Reform

Rationale: Reforming the justice system to focus on rehabilitation over punitive measures, while ensuring accountability in policing, could help reduce mass incarceration and systemic racial disparities.

Potential Impact: Safer communities, more efficient use of resources, and the restoration of trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.

6. Campaign Finance and Electoral Reforms

Rationale: Reducing the influence of money in politics could lead to more representative governance and policies that better reflect public needs rather than special interests.

Potential Impact: Increased voter confidence, fairer policy outcomes, and a political environment more conducive to enacting long-term reforms.","Intel's new CEO warns employees about 'tough decisions', but Wall Street cheers",technology,positive

"By George Steer:

*[...] The US stock exchange had been marketing to selected customers a new fibre optic cable that cuts the time to execute trades on its market by up to a third, drawing the ire of competitors who were unaware of the unpublicised service.*

*The dispute underscores how the technological arms race that underpins modern day trading is heating up again as cheaper and more efficient equipment becomes available.*

*In February US telecoms group McKay Brothers complained to the US stock market regulator that Nasdaq was ‚Äúcovertly‚Äù offering some customers access to hollow-core fibre optic cables, which can carry trading data far quicker than the standard solid-core counterparts.*

*When approached for comment by the Financial Times, Nasdaq said: ‚ÄúIn close consultation with the regulator and our clients, Nasdaq has begun discontinuing the service.‚Äù*

*[...] Global equity markets are dominated by high-frequency trading firms that use complex algorithms to spot price patterns and automatically place huge volumes of very small trades.*

*For firms seeking out arbitrage pricing discrepancies that can last for as little as 10 millionths of a second, even tiny speed increases translate into a critical advantage.*

*In its letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, McKay alleged that Nasdaq ‚Äî the second most active stock trading venue in the US by volume after the New York Stock Exchange ‚Äî had been selling the right to upgrade to the faster cables for an additional monthly fee of $10,000, without publicly disclosing that it was doing so.*","Nasdaq has ‚Äòbegun discontinuing‚Äô a high-speed trading service offered to a handful of its clients ‚Äî Unpublicised access to hollow-core fibre optic cables cuts the time to execute trades, by up to a third",technology,positive

"From the article: Earlier this week, the Federal Trade Commission claimed that it could not pursue a case against Amazon due to the large resource and budget cuts being made by Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency. However, in a bizarre reversal, the company took back its previous statements, claiming that the FTC did, indeed, have the resources to move forward with the case.

The trial case in question involves Amazon‚Äôs alleged manipulative practices in signing users up for subscriptions. At a hearing on Wednesday, Jonathan Cohen, an attorney for the FTC, asked US District Judge John Chun to delay the trial until September due to the resource and personnel shortfalls at the agency, Bloomberg reports.

‚ÄúWe have lost employees in the agency, in our division, and on our case team,‚Äù Cohen told the judge, further noting that ‚Äúthere is an extremely severe resource shortfall in terms of money and personnel.‚Äù Cohen further said that the agency was so strapped that it ‚Äúmay not be able to purchase the transcript from Wednesday‚Äôs hearing.‚Äù

The statement followed an announcement that DOGE had canceled some 200,000 government credit cards across the federal government, severely limiting the spending that those agencies could make.

Not long after the hearing, however, the attorney reached back out to the court to claim that he had been mistaken. ‚ÄúI was wrong,‚Äù Cohen said. ‚ÄúThe Commission does not have resource constraints, and we are fully prepared to litigate this case,‚Äù the lawyer relayed. ‚ÄúPlease be assured that the FTC will meet whatever schedule and deadlines the court sets.‚Äù","FTC Claims That It Can‚Äôt Take on Amazon Case Due to DOGE Cuts, Then Changes Its Mind | The federal agency appeared to realize this was not a good look for Trump.",technology,negative

"My main 3 problems with Linux when giving it to other (non-techy) people:

1.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Bitlocker is so so easy. Users can enable or disable it in minutes, change the password in seconds, and their files are protected if they lose the laptop or someone else tries to get their files. And only requires a password, PIN or biometrics (face or fingerprint). In Linux the only similar thing is LuKS, and some time ago and in some distributions, is either a pain to correctly configure, or just insecure (not using TPM, saving keys to the same disk)

Also, Bitlocker works in everything, including external drives, pendrives‚Ä¶ and you can open it in Mac (with extensions) and Linux (Dislocker). LuKS needs Gnome Disk Utility if you want a GUI, and if not, using terminal to encrypt a Pendrive (install necessary packages, identify device, create LUKS partition, open it, format encrypted device, mount it, unmount and close - very 60yo noob friendly). Not working in Windows, so good luck if trying a non-Linux PC.

2) Sooner or later you will need the terminal and copy-pasting unknown commands from internet to fix or do something. And sometimes, with unknown results, just like that video of Linus Tech Tips installing Steam from the terminal in PopOS, just for it to uninstall the GUI (and practically destroying the entire system for a noob person that wouldn‚Äôt know how to fix that), because a bug. Noobs don‚Äôt want terminal commands, they just want GUIs and easy to understand questions, buttons and so on, they are not computer engineers and don‚Äôt want to be.

3) Incompatibilities. Google Drive isn‚Äôt there, so you need to pay a 3rd party option or using RClone (and welcome back to using terminal and guiding through making yourself an API connection in the Google Console! Very noob-friendly and plug-n-play!). Office doesn‚Äôt exist, so use the webapp or just a 3rd party alternative that maybe or maybe not works 100% fine with whatever excel file you work with and its particular extensions needed or formulas. Oh, you want to control your battery just like in Windows, or want to cap your CPU performance at your liking to avoid noise and battery running low? Good luck, go and see if either a Gnome Shell Extension from a random dev or try CPU power-gui. Oh! It doesn‚Äôt keep the config after restart? Easy, put it in crontab, very noob friendly and easy!

Also, very funny the top comment in a person asking for ‚Äúhow to limit CPU frequency‚Äù in LinuxMint (noob distro) in Reddit, is just like ‚ÄúArchLinux wiki is very informative, link‚Äù and goes to a techy page about CPU scaling and about 9 different options, without much info about how to install, configure or use, a noob-hell. Even that page says ‚ÄúThe factual accuracy of this article is disputed‚Äù because Arch guys are arguing about commands, imagine a noob reacting to that.

Not to speak about some people in the Linux community acting a bit a**holes when noobs need help, or just disregarding things like ‚Äúare you stupid? It‚Äôs easy, do this and ready‚Äù, when the user asking doesn‚Äôt know even where to start.

**At the end of the day, I only see Linux (when talking about noob people) capable of running as a web-browser machine and nothing more. Just like what Chromium was at start. Start, open browser, surf the internet, close. Only then, it can work for a noob, usually, in the long term.**",E-waste or Linux?

*The JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday that those historical cases were ""confined to a single market, whereas the decline in Tesla sales in 2025 is not specific to any one nation or geography.""*

*[...] ""Mr. Musk's work with the Department of Government Efficiency has proven controversial domestically, and while as many members of the political right may be pleased as those on the left are displeased, the effect on Tesla sales seems nevertheless negative,"" JPMorgan analysts wrote.*

*[The] analysts are also concerned that Musk's focus on political affairs is again distracting the CEO from his core businesses.*

"As much as I don't like Ron DeSantis, I think there is some kind of merit in trying to keep children off social media, especially with what we see now in how it affects them. 

It's not even just about potential self-esteem issues, but also cyber bullying, and even the fact that they have so much dopamine running through them that teachers have a hard time trying to even educate them because they have such short attention spans. 

Granted I can't stand there and talk about education and Florida with all the other crap DeSantis pulled. 

Still, I often think that maybe there needs to be something done to keep children off social media and even to stop parents from setting up social media accounts for their children when they are born. Like as if there's going to be some huge timeline for them growing up on this. 

I don't know if the $50,000 fine is ideal, as I could imagine a parent that didn't give their child permission suddenly lying and saying they did to avoid paying a fine, but I often wonder if we should be doing more to get children off social media and internet/smartphone addiction as well as get rid of nanny State that forces them to stay home or only go to schedule activities because they're not allowed anymore to go out and play freely without adult supervision. 

That to me needs to be the next step. Make free-range parenting legal and no one can judge. I don't care if you won't let your kid out of the house without you watching them and you just spend your time shuffling them from one activity to the next, some parents just want to go old school and let their kids go out and play like they did when they were children.","In victory for DeSantis, judge won't block Florida ban on social media for young teenagers",technology,positive

"By Jennifer Szalai:

*[...] ‚ÄúCareless People‚Äù is darkly funny and genuinely shocking: an ugly, detailed portrait of one of the most powerful companies in the world. What Wynn-Williams reveals will undoubtedly trigger her former bosses‚Äô ire.*

*Not only does she have the storytelling chops to unspool a gripping narrative; she also delivers the goods.*

*During her time at Facebook, Wynn-Williams worked closely with its chief executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg. They‚Äôre this book‚Äôs Tom and Daisy ‚Äî the ‚Äúcareless people‚Äù in ‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby‚Äù who, as Wynn-Williams quotes the novel in her epigraph, ‚Äúsmashed up things and creatures‚Äù and ‚Äúlet other people clean up the mess they had made.‚Äù*

*[...] Wynn-Williams is aghast to discover that Sandberg has instructed her 26-year-old assistant to buy lingerie for both of them, budget be damned. (The total cost is $13,000.) During a long drive in Europe, the assistant and Sandberg take turns sleeping in each other‚Äôs laps, stroking each other‚Äôs hair.*

*On the 12-hour flight home on a private jet, a pajama-clad Sandberg claims the only bed on the plane and repeatedly demands that Wynn-Williams ‚Äúcome to bed.‚Äù Wynn-Williams demurs. Sandberg is miffed.*

*Sandberg isn‚Äôt the only person in this book with apparent boundary issues. Wynn-Williams has uncomfortable encounters with Joel Kaplan, an ex-boyfriend of Sandberg‚Äôs from Harvard, who was hired as Facebook‚Äôs vice president of U.S. policy and eventually became vice president of global policy ‚Äî Wynn-Williams‚Äôs manager.*

*A former Marine who clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia and who was part of the ‚ÄúBrooks Brothers riot‚Äù of 2000, which helped bring George W. Bush into office, Kaplan went on to serve as a deputy chief of staff in his administration. Wynn-Williams describes Kaplan grinding up against her on the dance floor at a work event, announcing that she looks ‚Äúsultry‚Äù and making ‚Äúweird comments‚Äù about her husband.*

*[...] The book includes a detailed chapter on ‚ÄúAldrin,‚Äù the code name for Facebook‚Äôs project to get unblocked in China. According to Wynn-Williams, the company proposed all kinds of byzantine arrangements involving China-based partnerships, data collection and censorship tools that it hoped would satisfy China‚Äôs ruling Communist Party.*

*Knowing that Zuckerberg would probably face questions about China from Congress, his team gave him cleverly worded talking points.*

*When Zuckerberg eventually appears before a Senate committee in 2018, a senator asks him how Facebook is handling the Chinese government‚Äôs unwillingness ‚Äúto allow a social media platform ‚Äî foreign or domestic ‚Äî to operate in China unless it agrees to abide by Chinese law.‚Äù*

*In his reply, Zuckerberg states, ‚ÄúNo decisions have been made around the conditions under which any possible future service might be offered in China,‚Äù to which Wynn-Williams comments: ‚ÄúHe lies.‚Äù*","Zuckerberg ‚Äòlied‚Äô to Senate, Sandberg asked me to bed, says Sarah Wynn-Williams (former Facebook executive and author of ‚ÄòCareless People‚Äô)",technology,negative

A lot of Linux is too unfamiliar to people, and there are still a bunch of quirks here and there to iron out.

I've seen people who were unfamiliar with Linux / having never used Linux, pick up Mint Cinnamon for their day to day without an issue.

"By Jennifer Szalai:

*[...] ‚ÄúCareless People‚Äù is darkly funny and genuinely shocking: an ugly, detailed portrait of one of the most powerful companies in the world. What Wynn-Williams reveals will undoubtedly trigger her former bosses‚Äô ire.*

*Not only does she have the storytelling chops to unspool a gripping narrative; she also delivers the goods.*

*During her time at Facebook, Wynn-Williams worked closely with its chief executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg. They‚Äôre this book‚Äôs Tom and Daisy ‚Äî the ‚Äúcareless people‚Äù in ‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby‚Äù who, as Wynn-Williams quotes the novel in her epigraph, ‚Äúsmashed up things and creatures‚Äù and ‚Äúlet other people clean up the mess they had made.‚Äù*

*[...] Wynn-Williams is aghast to discover that Sandberg has instructed her 26-year-old assistant to buy lingerie for both of them, budget be damned. (The total cost is $13,000.) During a long drive in Europe, the assistant and Sandberg take turns sleeping in each other‚Äôs laps, stroking each other‚Äôs hair.*

*On the 12-hour flight home on a private jet, a pajama-clad Sandberg claims the only bed on the plane and repeatedly demands that Wynn-Williams ‚Äúcome to bed.‚Äù Wynn-Williams demurs. Sandberg is miffed.*

*Sandberg isn‚Äôt the only person in this book with apparent boundary issues. Wynn-Williams has uncomfortable encounters with Joel Kaplan, an ex-boyfriend of Sandberg‚Äôs from Harvard, who was hired as Facebook‚Äôs vice president of U.S. policy and eventually became vice president of global policy ‚Äî Wynn-Williams‚Äôs manager.*

*A former Marine who clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia and who was part of the ‚ÄúBrooks Brothers riot‚Äù of 2000, which helped bring George W. Bush into office, Kaplan went on to serve as a deputy chief of staff in his administration. Wynn-Williams describes Kaplan grinding up against her on the dance floor at a work event, announcing that she looks ‚Äúsultry‚Äù and making ‚Äúweird comments‚Äù about her husband.*

*[...] The book includes a detailed chapter on ‚ÄúAldrin,‚Äù the code name for Facebook‚Äôs project to get unblocked in China. According to Wynn-Williams, the company proposed all kinds of byzantine arrangements involving China-based partnerships, data collection and censorship tools that it hoped would satisfy China‚Äôs ruling Communist Party.*

*Knowing that Zuckerberg would probably face questions about China from Congress, his team gave him cleverly worded talking points.*

*When Zuckerberg eventually appears before a Senate committee in 2018, a senator asks him how Facebook is handling the Chinese government‚Äôs unwillingness ‚Äúto allow a social media platform ‚Äî foreign or domestic ‚Äî to operate in China unless it agrees to abide by Chinese law.‚Äù*

*In his reply, Zuckerberg states, ‚ÄúNo decisions have been made around the conditions under which any possible future service might be offered in China,‚Äù to which Wynn-Williams comments: ‚ÄúHe lies.‚Äù*","Zuckerberg ‚Äòlied‚Äô to Senate, Sandberg asked me to bed, says Sarah Wynn-Williams (former Facebook executive and author of ‚ÄòCareless People‚Äô)",technology,negative

"By Jennifer Szalai:

*[...] ‚ÄúCareless People‚Äù is darkly funny and genuinely shocking: an ugly, detailed portrait of one of the most powerful companies in the world. What Wynn-Williams reveals will undoubtedly trigger her former bosses‚Äô ire.*

*Not only does she have the storytelling chops to unspool a gripping narrative; she also delivers the goods.*

*During her time at Facebook, Wynn-Williams worked closely with its chief executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg. They‚Äôre this book‚Äôs Tom and Daisy ‚Äî the ‚Äúcareless people‚Äù in ‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby‚Äù who, as Wynn-Williams quotes the novel in her epigraph, ‚Äúsmashed up things and creatures‚Äù and ‚Äúlet other people clean up the mess they had made.‚Äù*

*[...] Wynn-Williams is aghast to discover that Sandberg has instructed her 26-year-old assistant to buy lingerie for both of them, budget be damned. (The total cost is $13,000.) During a long drive in Europe, the assistant and Sandberg take turns sleeping in each other‚Äôs laps, stroking each other‚Äôs hair.*

*On the 12-hour flight home on a private jet, a pajama-clad Sandberg claims the only bed on the plane and repeatedly demands that Wynn-Williams ‚Äúcome to bed.‚Äù Wynn-Williams demurs. Sandberg is miffed.*

*Sandberg isn‚Äôt the only person in this book with apparent boundary issues. Wynn-Williams has uncomfortable encounters with Joel Kaplan, an ex-boyfriend of Sandberg‚Äôs from Harvard, who was hired as Facebook‚Äôs vice president of U.S. policy and eventually became vice president of global policy ‚Äî Wynn-Williams‚Äôs manager.*

*A former Marine who clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia and who was part of the ‚ÄúBrooks Brothers riot‚Äù of 2000, which helped bring George W. Bush into office, Kaplan went on to serve as a deputy chief of staff in his administration. Wynn-Williams describes Kaplan grinding up against her on the dance floor at a work event, announcing that she looks ‚Äúsultry‚Äù and making ‚Äúweird comments‚Äù about her husband.*

*[...] The book includes a detailed chapter on ‚ÄúAldrin,‚Äù the code name for Facebook‚Äôs project to get unblocked in China. According to Wynn-Williams, the company proposed all kinds of byzantine arrangements involving China-based partnerships, data collection and censorship tools that it hoped would satisfy China‚Äôs ruling Communist Party.*

*Knowing that Zuckerberg would probably face questions about China from Congress, his team gave him cleverly worded talking points.*

*When Zuckerberg eventually appears before a Senate committee in 2018, a senator asks him how Facebook is handling the Chinese government‚Äôs unwillingness ‚Äúto allow a social media platform ‚Äî foreign or domestic ‚Äî to operate in China unless it agrees to abide by Chinese law.‚Äù*

*In his reply, Zuckerberg states, ‚ÄúNo decisions have been made around the conditions under which any possible future service might be offered in China,‚Äù to which Wynn-Williams comments: ‚ÄúHe lies.‚Äù*","Zuckerberg ‚Äòlied‚Äô to Senate, Sandberg asked me to bed, says Sarah Wynn-Williams (former Facebook executive and author of ‚ÄòCareless People‚Äô)",technology,negative

"From the article: Earlier this week, the Federal Trade Commission claimed that it could not pursue a case against Amazon due to the large resource and budget cuts being made by Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency. However, in a bizarre reversal, the company took back its previous statements, claiming that the FTC did, indeed, have the resources to move forward with the case.

The trial case in question involves Amazon‚Äôs alleged manipulative practices in signing users up for subscriptions. At a hearing on Wednesday, Jonathan Cohen, an attorney for the FTC, asked US District Judge John Chun to delay the trial until September due to the resource and personnel shortfalls at the agency, Bloomberg reports.

‚ÄúWe have lost employees in the agency, in our division, and on our case team,‚Äù Cohen told the judge, further noting that ‚Äúthere is an extremely severe resource shortfall in terms of money and personnel.‚Äù Cohen further said that the agency was so strapped that it ‚Äúmay not be able to purchase the transcript from Wednesday‚Äôs hearing.‚Äù

The statement followed an announcement that DOGE had canceled some 200,000 government credit cards across the federal government, severely limiting the spending that those agencies could make.

Not long after the hearing, however, the attorney reached back out to the court to claim that he had been mistaken. ‚ÄúI was wrong,‚Äù Cohen said. ‚ÄúThe Commission does not have resource constraints, and we are fully prepared to litigate this case,‚Äù the lawyer relayed. ‚ÄúPlease be assured that the FTC will meet whatever schedule and deadlines the court sets.‚Äù","FTC Claims That It Can‚Äôt Take on Amazon Case Due to DOGE Cuts, Then Changes Its Mind | The federal agency appeared to realize this was not a good look for Trump.",technology,negative

"This reminds me of a case.

In the early 2010s, a Brazilian whistleblower prosecution attorney was found dead inside his own apartment. The case was officially ruled as a suicide, but you won‚Äôt find much about it, because it was swept under the rug.

I worked as a security engineer at the time and I personally met his mother. She was adamant that he had been killed, he had signs of struggling and it seems he was strangled. The CCTV footage from that day mysteriously cut off at a certain time, leaving no record beyond that point.

A toxicology report later found traces of GHB and alcohol in his system, even though he was not prescribed antidepressants and did not drink.

When they found him and reported it to the authorities, the forensics team arrived but did not retrieve the body and instead locked the place down. 

Two hours later, ""agents"" came in and seized files and his computer, leaving his apartment completely ransacked. Then his body was finally removed from the apartment.

She had to escalate her case from the initial authorities all the way up to federal instances just to track down his computer. When her appeal was finally successful and she retrieved it, she discovered that it had been completely formatted.

Then, when I got my hands on the computer, I discovered something that completely devastated her. It wasn‚Äôt even his computer. It appeared to be either a reassembled machine or one where they had kept the original hard drive.

When I removed the hard drive, I noticed a sticker from a Brazilian government department. It could have been placed there intentionally, but it looked like an official patrimony seal.

To confirm my suspicions, I ran a tool to check for any previous or deleted data. The results were clear: it was a raw, brand-new disk.

So, I am skeptical, but maybe Suchi Balaji didn't kill himself, we will never know.","‚ÄòMurder conspiracy‚Äô: OpenAI whistleblower Suchir Balaji's mom shares pic from day of his death, claims several CCTV cameras ‚Äòstopped working‚Äô",technology,positive

"From the article: Earlier this week, the Federal Trade Commission claimed that it could not pursue a case against Amazon due to the large resource and budget cuts being made by Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency. However, in a bizarre reversal, the company took back its previous statements, claiming that the FTC did, indeed, have the resources to move forward with the case.

The trial case in question involves Amazon‚Äôs alleged manipulative practices in signing users up for subscriptions. At a hearing on Wednesday, Jonathan Cohen, an attorney for the FTC, asked US District Judge John Chun to delay the trial until September due to the resource and personnel shortfalls at the agency, Bloomberg reports.

‚ÄúWe have lost employees in the agency, in our division, and on our case team,‚Äù Cohen told the judge, further noting that ‚Äúthere is an extremely severe resource shortfall in terms of money and personnel.‚Äù Cohen further said that the agency was so strapped that it ‚Äúmay not be able to purchase the transcript from Wednesday‚Äôs hearing.‚Äù

The statement followed an announcement that DOGE had canceled some 200,000 government credit cards across the federal government, severely limiting the spending that those agencies could make.

Not long after the hearing, however, the attorney reached back out to the court to claim that he had been mistaken. ‚ÄúI was wrong,‚Äù Cohen said. ‚ÄúThe Commission does not have resource constraints, and we are fully prepared to litigate this case,‚Äù the lawyer relayed. ‚ÄúPlease be assured that the FTC will meet whatever schedule and deadlines the court sets.‚Äù","FTC Claims That It Can‚Äôt Take on Amazon Case Due to DOGE Cuts, Then Changes Its Mind | The federal agency appeared to realize this was not a good look for Trump.",technology,negative

"and here‚Äôs ur _too long, probably won‚Äôt read:_


Apple Inc.‚Äôs top executive overseeing its Siri virtual assistant told staff that delays to key features have been ugly and embarrassing, and a decision to publicly promote the technology before it was ready made matters worse.

Robby Walker, who serves as a senior director at Apple, delivered the stark comments during an all-hands meeting for the Siri division, saying that the team was facing a bad period. Walker also said that it‚Äôs unclear when the enhancements will actually launch, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the gathering was private.

The frank discussion shows the extent of Apple‚Äôs crisis in the field of artificial intelligence, where it‚Äôs struggling to catch up with peers. Siri ‚Äî less advanced than rival systems ‚Äî has become a symbol of Apple‚Äôs AI challenges. And the company‚Äôs woes boiled over last week, when it acknowledged publicly that critical features would be delayed indefinitely. 

During the all-hands gathering, Walker suggested that employees on his team may be feeling angry, disappointed, burned out and embarrassed after the features were postponed. The company had been racing to get the technology ready for this spring, but now the features aren‚Äôt expected until next year at the earliest, people familiar with the matter have said. 

Still, he praised the team for developing ‚Äúincredibly impressive‚Äù features and vowed to deliver an industry-leading virtual assistant to consumers. 

On Feb. 14, Bloomberg News reported that Apple was struggling with bugs and engineering problems on its planned artificial intelligence tools for Siri. At the time, the company postponed the release from April to May, aiming to include the features in its iOS 18.5 operating system. Now it‚Äôs looking to add them as an update as early as the iOS 19 software cycle next year.

The features ‚Äî unveiled last June at Apple‚Äôs Worldwide Developers Conference ‚Äî are fundamental to making Siri a more effective personal assistant. The technology will allow the software to tap into users‚Äô personal data to better respond to queries. It also will let Siri more precisely control apps and analyze content that‚Äôs on a user‚Äôs screen.

But when Apple demonstrated the features at WWDC using a video mock-up, it only had a barely working prototype, Bloomberg has reported. Walker told staff in the meeting that the delays were especially ‚Äúugly‚Äù because Apple had already showed off the features publicly. ‚ÄúThis was not one of these situations where we get to show people our plan after it‚Äôs done,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe showed people before.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo make matters worse,‚Äù Walker said, Apple‚Äôs marketing communications department wanted to promote the enhancements. Despite not being ready, the capabilities were included in a series of marketing campaigns and TV commercials starting last year.

Apple touted the features as a key selling point of the iPhone 16 line, which otherwise lacked major changes. And it‚Äôs part of a broader AI push called Apple Intelligence.

Walker also raised doubts about even meeting the current release expectations. Though Apple is aiming for iOS 19, it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt mean that we‚Äôre shipping then,‚Äù Walker said. The company has several more priorities in development, and trade-offs will need to be made, he said.

‚ÄúWe have other commitments across Apple to other projects,‚Äù Walker said, citing new software and hardware initiatives. ‚ÄúWe want to keep our commitments to those, and we understand those are now potentially more timeline-urgent than the features that have been deferred.‚Äù He said decisions on timing will be made on a ‚Äúcase-by-case basis‚Äù as work progresses on products planned for next year.

‚ÄúCustomers are not expecting only these new features but they also want a more fully rounded-out Siri,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to ship these features and more as soon as they are ready.‚Äù

Walker said that there is ‚Äúintense personal accountability‚Äù about this effort shared by his boss John Giannandrea, the head of AI at Apple, as well as software chief Craig Federighi and other executives.

As of Friday, Apple doesn‚Äôt plan to immediately fire any top executives over the AI crisis, according to people with knowledge of the matter. That decision could theoretically change at any time. In any case, the company is poised to make management adjustments. It has discussed moving more senior executives under Giannandrea to assist with a turnaround effort. Already, the company tapped longtime executive Kim Vorrath ‚Äî seen as a project fixer ‚Äî to assist the group.

Walker said the decision to delay the features was made because of quality issues and that the company has found the technology only works properly up to two-thirds to 80% of the time. He said the group ‚Äúcan make more progress to get those percentages up, so that users get something they can really count on.‚Äù

In recent weeks, Federighi voiced concerns to other senior executives that the features weren‚Äôt working as advertised, ultimately prompting the decision to delay, Bloomberg reported. Issues with Apple Intelligence were clear from the start, with the company postponing the first batch of features last year and providing vague timelines during its launch event.

Walker defended his Siri group, telling them that they should be proud. Employees poured their ‚Äúhearts and souls into this thing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI saw so many people giving everything they had in order to make this happen and to make incredible progress together.‚Äù

But Apple wants to maintain a high bar and only deliver the features when they‚Äôre polished, he said. ‚ÄúThese are not quite ready to go to the general public, even though our competitors might have launched them in this state or worse.‚Äù

He showed examples during the meeting of the technology working: It was able to locate his driver‚Äôs license number on command and find specific photos of a child. He also demonstrated how the technology could precisely manipulate apps via voice control. It embedded content in an email, added recipients and made other changes.

Walker told staff that they should ‚Äúfeel really proud of innovative work‚Äù done to develop the personal search feature, despite saying it doesn‚Äôt always work sufficiently.

Still, the company has met other goals for Siri. That includes bringing a Type-to-Siri interface to iOS 18, as well as adding Apple product knowledge to the platform and an improved understanding of customers. It‚Äôs planning to offer Apple Intelligence in several new languages next month and is working overtime to enable the features for China as part of partnerships with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc.

The executive said he didn‚Äôt want things to get worse before they got better, saying that special attention will need to be paid to the integration of existing features into iOS 19.

But there‚Äôs still a long road ahead. The delayed Siri features are just the first step toward modernizing the software. Apple has been planning upgrades for 2027 that will make Siri more conversational, letting it better compete with other AI chatbots, Bloomberg has reported.",Apple‚Äôs Siri Chief Calls AI Delays Ugly and Embarrassing,technology,positive

"Some key points:

>On Friday or earlier, the source code for all versions of tj-actions/changed-files received unauthorized updates that changed the ""tags"" developers use to reference specific code versions. The tags pointed to a publicly available file that copies the internal memory of severs running it, searches for credentials, and writes them to a log. In the aftermath, many publicly accessible repositories running tj-actions ended up displaying their most sensitive credentials in logs anyone could view.
>
>""The scary part of actions is that they can often modify the source code of the repository that is using them and access any secret variables associated with a workflow,"" HD Moore, founder and CEO of runZero and an expert in open source security, said in an interview. ""The most paranoid use of actions is to audit all of the source code, then pin the specific commit hash instead of the tag into the ... the workflow, but this is a hassle.""
>
>As the supply-chain attack demonstrates, many GitHub users weren't following these best practices. Repositories using tj-actions that trusted tags rather than hashes of vetted versions ended up running the memory scraper/logger. The attack poses a possible threat to any such repository, because credentials should never appear in human-readable form. The risk is most acute for repositories that are publicly viewable, since the credentials are then viewable by anyone.
>
>A tj-actions maintainer said Saturday that the attacker somehow compromised a credential a @tj-actions-bot uses to obtain privileged access to the compromised repository. The maintainer said it remained unclear how the credential was compromised. The password used by the bot has since been changed, and for added security, the account is now protected by a passkey, a form of credential that, as specified by the FIDO Alliance, requires two-factor authentication by default.
>
>GitHub officials said in a statement that they have no evidence the company or its platform has been compromised.
>
>...
>
>In a separate writeup, researchers at security firm Wiz said preliminary analysis of the attack has already established that dozens of tj-actions users have faced real harm in the supply-chain attack. The researchers wrote:
>
>""While conducting threat hunting related to this malicious activity, in several instances Wiz Threat Research has observed the deployment of a script designed to dump secrets as part of the malicious payload's execution. Additionally, Wiz Threat Research has so far identified dozens of repositories affected by the malicious GitHub action, including repos operated by large enterprise organizations. In these repositories, the malicious payload successfully executed and caused secrets to leak in workflow logs. Some of the leaked secrets we've identified so far include valid AWS access keys, GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs), npm [tokens], private RSA Keys and more.""

"From the article: Earlier this week, the Federal Trade Commission claimed that it could not pursue a case against Amazon due to the large resource and budget cuts being made by Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency. However, in a bizarre reversal, the company took back its previous statements, claiming that the FTC did, indeed, have the resources to move forward with the case.

The trial case in question involves Amazon‚Äôs alleged manipulative practices in signing users up for subscriptions. At a hearing on Wednesday, Jonathan Cohen, an attorney for the FTC, asked US District Judge John Chun to delay the trial until September due to the resource and personnel shortfalls at the agency, Bloomberg reports.

‚ÄúWe have lost employees in the agency, in our division, and on our case team,‚Äù Cohen told the judge, further noting that ‚Äúthere is an extremely severe resource shortfall in terms of money and personnel.‚Äù Cohen further said that the agency was so strapped that it ‚Äúmay not be able to purchase the transcript from Wednesday‚Äôs hearing.‚Äù

The statement followed an announcement that DOGE had canceled some 200,000 government credit cards across the federal government, severely limiting the spending that those agencies could make.

Not long after the hearing, however, the attorney reached back out to the court to claim that he had been mistaken. ‚ÄúI was wrong,‚Äù Cohen said. ‚ÄúThe Commission does not have resource constraints, and we are fully prepared to litigate this case,‚Äù the lawyer relayed. ‚ÄúPlease be assured that the FTC will meet whatever schedule and deadlines the court sets.‚Äù","FTC Claims That It Can‚Äôt Take on Amazon Case Due to DOGE Cuts, Then Changes Its Mind | The federal agency appeared to realize this was not a good look for Trump.",technology,negative

"This is the best explainer I've seen on why the Win11 hardware requirements are so aggressive: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/why-windows-11-has-such-strict-hardware-requirements-according-to-microsoft/

tl;dr:

>Windows 11 (and also Windows 10!) uses virtualization-based security, or VBS, to isolate parts of system memory from the rest of the system. VBS includes an optional feature called ""memory integrity."" That's the more user-friendly name for something called Hypervisor-protected code integrity, or HVCI. HVCI can be enabled on any Windows 10 PC that doesn't have driver incompatibility issues, but older computers will incur a significant performance penalty because their processors don't support mode-based execution control, or MBEC. And that acronym seems to be at the root of Windows 11's CPU support list. If it supports MBEC, generally, it's in. If it doesn't, it's out. MBEC support is only included in relatively new processors, starting with the Kaby Lake and Skylake-X architectures on Intel's side, and the Zen 2 architecture on AMD's side‚Äîthis matches pretty closely, albeit not exactly, with the Windows 11 processor support lists.

You can [flip a registry key to upgrade to Win11 anyway](https://old.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/1hcw593/how_to_upgrade_to_windows_11_on_unsupported/) and then [disable VBS](https://old.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1fums7b/psa_disabling_memory_integrity_in_windows_11_24h2/), and AFAIK Win11 will run fine afterwards, but you're in an officially unsupported configuration so most institutions won't be willing or able to take the risk.",E-waste or Linux?

"This is increasingly becoming an indictment of how big tech monopolies are hurting American tech.

Chinese tech scene is brutally competitive, there are like 15 different companies and models that are super competitive. 

Here, all the oxygen has been sucked out by 3-4 big tech companies and startups they bless make it and others don‚Äôt. Big tech is also hoarding up talent, talent which would have gone out and innovated. They are pricing top talent out of actual startups that want to innovate. 

In the US, endless cash with big tech is now actively stifling innovation as they are just used to throwing money buying more compute instead of actually innovating.

"Russia is ramping up hybrid warfare in Italy, combining cyberattacks, disinformation, and influence operations to weaken Rome‚Äôs support for Ukraine and destabilise its institutions. The Kremlin‚Äôs tactics include direct verbal attacks on President Mattarella, targeting Italian academia, and leveraging ideological narratives through figures like Alexander Dugin. Italy remains a prime target due to its geopolitical significance and internal divisions A targeted offensive. Russia is intensifying its hybrid warfare campaign in Italy, blending cyber-attacks, disinformation, and influence operations.

The goal: weaken Rome‚Äôs steadfast support for Ukraine, exploit institutional divisions, and erode public consensus around Italy‚Äôs Euro-Atlantic alignment. Tactics in play. For weeks, Russian-linked hacker groups have targeted Italian government websites and key infrastructure in retaliation for Italy‚Äôs military and diplomatic backing of Ukraine.

Meanwhile, the Kremlin has escalated its rhetoric, with Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova launching a second verbal attack on President of the Republic Sergio Mattarella within a month. Italy is not taking this lightly. Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani condemned the Kremlin‚Äôs move, calling Mattarella ‚Äúa man of peace and a symbol of national and European unity.‚Äù

In a rare diplomatic move, Tajani ordered the Russian ambassador in Rome to be summoned‚Äîa strong signal of Italy‚Äôs institutional firmness. Russia aims to test Italy‚Äôs institutional compactness, particularly the unity between Mattarella and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose alignment with Ukraine has provided Italy with rare strategic coherence.

The battle for academia. Italian universities have become soft targets for Russian influence operations:

The University of Turin screened Maidan: la strada verso la guerra, a Kremlin-backed documentary sanctioned by the EU.
The event featured Vincenzo Lorusso, a journalist tied to International Reporters, a media outlet funded by Russia‚Äôs Ministry of Digital Development, per Reporters Sans Fronti√®res.
Roma Tre University hosted Giorgio Bianchi, identified by Italian intelligence as a ‚Äúpro-Russian propagandist‚Äù active in Ukraine.

"It‚Äôs clear that no one here knows how AI generated art works. To have AI art that looks good, has proper anatomy, is properly displaying subjects or objects that you want, in an environment that you want, interacting properly, dressed properly, looks properly, takes hours and hours and hours of work.

Between the amount of generations you need to make, the paragraphs of proper prompts you need to make, the AI models you need to choose from, knowing how to direct the camera, the lighting, the post editing, pre-editing, and detail fixing, you need to know and need to be skilled in nearly every aspect of classic and digital art. Plus you need to know how to direct a scene.

I will admit the ceiling for random but recognizable art generation in AI is low, especially if you don‚Äôt care what it makes, but if you are looking for a very specific good generated AI art then it takes lots of effort skill and talent.

The best analogy I can think of is the person using AI as being a director/producer/writer, and the art that‚Äôs being used as a reference as being the actors. You could put random actors in a room and tell them to improv a movie while you record it doing nothing else, and you could probably get something entertaining if incoherent.

‚ÄúI have a foreboding of an America in my children‚Äôs or grandchildren‚Äôs time‚Äîwhen the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what‚Äôs true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd when the dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites now down to 10 seconds or less, lowest-common-denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance.‚Äù","‚ÄòWe Are Witnessing a New Brain Drain‚Äô as Scientists Flee America for France. | A French university says it's providing safe harbor to American scientists from Yale, Stanford, NASA, and the NIH.",technology,positive

If you get in a cab, take a trip, and it works perfectly, that is nice. Can you take 99 cab rides and it makes one mistake that results in an accident? That is 99% reliable.

Can you take 999 cab rides without an accident? That is 99.9% reliability.

And so on. We need to get to something like a couple of million hours without a mistake. 

People are taking one ride in FSD and remarking how much better this version is than the last one was. This means that Tesla FSD is still making enough mistakes that people notice them. If this were close to ready, FSD would make no mistakes 99 out of 100 rides, and then it would need to be improved to 99.9%, 99.99%, and 99.999% with no mistakes. During this improvement process, which would take maybe years, most people would notice no improvements at all. 

The fact that people are still seeing improvements - which means they are still seeing mistakes and awkward moments - means that FSD is \*\*NOWHERE\*\* near ready to be fully autonomous.

"From the article: Last week, Aix Marseille University, France‚Äôs largest university, invited American scientists who believe their work is at risk of being censored by Donald Trump administration‚Äôs anti-science policies to continue their research in France. Today, the university announced that it is already seeing great interest from scientists at NASA, Yale, Stanford, and other American schools and government agencies, and that it wants to expand the program to other schools and European countries to absorb all the researchers who want to leave the United States. 

‚ÄúWe are witnessing a new brain drain,‚Äù √âric Berton, Aix Marseille University‚Äôs president, said in a press release. ‚ÄúWe will do everything in our power to help as many scientists as possible continue their research. However, we cannot meet all demands on our own. The Ministry of Education and Research is fully supporting and assisting us in this effort, which is intended to expand at both national and European levels.‚Äù

The press release from the university claims that researchers from Stanford, Yale, NASA, the National Institute of Health, George Washington University, ‚Äúand about 15 other prestigious institutions,"" are now considering ‚Äúscientific exile.‚Äù More than 40 American scientists have expressed interest in the program, it said. Their key research areas are ‚Äúhealth (LGBT+ medicine, epidemiology, infectious diseases, inequalities, immunology, etc.), environment and climate change (natural disaster management, greenhouse gases, social impact, artificial intelligence), humanities and social sciences (communication, psychology, history, cultural heritage), astrophysics.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe current Executive Orders have led to a termination of one of my research grants. While it was not a lot of money, it was a high profile, large national study,‚Äù one researcher who has reached out to Aix Marseille University in order to take advantage of the program told me. 404 Media granted the researcher anonymity because speaking about the program might jeopardize their current position at a leading American university. ‚ÄúWhile I have not had to lay off staff as a result of that particular cancellation, I will have to lay off staff if additional projects are terminated.

"Ok‚Ä¶ this probably will sound like a conspiracy theory‚Ä¶ but.

People in charge ‚Äúlike Elon musk‚Äù are firing everyone and placing Ai in charge of jobs. This will continue.

Eventually, half the country or more will be unemployed. They‚Äôre also cutting socialist programs. They will cut Medicaid, Medicare, SS, maybe food stamps and unemployment eventually. 

People will starve. And when it gets bad, the people will revolt. The people in charge must know this. 

So they‚Äôre two options. Universal basic income, which doesn‚Äôt seem like this administration is going that route‚Ä¶ or, population reduction. Through starvation, civil unrest, civil war, or just through genocide. Trump and Musk seem to idolize Hitler and other fascist who committed genocide.

This means that the pressure to announce or release -anything- to show they aren‚Äôt being left behind is tremendous.
